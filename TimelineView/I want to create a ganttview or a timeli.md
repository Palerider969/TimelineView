I want to create a ganttview or a timelineview, that helps me keep track of my projects. 
It shall help me to block out times for projects.
It is a horizontal bar chart, with the start and end representing the start and end date.
The Projects shall be planned as events with a start date and an end date and a describtion. These should be visible and editable in a list. The Description will also be the label on the bars in the chart.
The List and the Timelineview should be in two views that are split horizontal.

I would love the project to run in swiftui. If this is a problem, or another framework would be faster and easier to use I would go for React and Typescript as Second choice.

Please let me know, if this is understandable and provide a recap and your approach on the process.
Please keep the code as simple as possible - with as little code as possible, so we can progress quickly.
